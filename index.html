        <p>Hello, my name is Kyle Young. I am 21 years old; my birthday is July 11<sup>th</sup>, and attend Algonquin College for Interactive Media Design. I took this course knowing I was interested in the field but am not sure of a particular field I would want to pursue quite yet. Going into this course I was a little more interested in the photography and photo/video editing aspect but now starting the course I am very interested in the coding aspect as well. A fun fact about me is that just last week on May 2<sup>nd</sup> I got my nose pierced.</p>
